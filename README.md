# CSGO-Cheats
This has developed into a monstrosity over the last 5 years. I donâ€™t feel like taking the time to refactor.

I have received a ton of guidance from the people over at [unknowncheats](http://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/index.php). Many code snippets have been taken from there, particularly the math functions and the drawing functions.

This is an external/internal cheat. It is designed to be injected in some way into a 3rd party process (like Chrome) which then interacts with CSGO. It is designed to be a skill enhancement cheat not a rage cheat.
